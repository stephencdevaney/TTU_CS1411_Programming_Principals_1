# CS1411 Programming Principals 1 Fall 2018 Texas Tech University

## Course Objectives:
The purpose of this course to expand the studentsâ€™ knowledge of computer science and the craft of programming. The course will delve into problem analysis, data modeling, and algorithm/program development. Students who succeed in this course will:
1. have a basic understanding of what the discipline of Computer Science involves
2. be able to read and develop imperative programs of simple to moderate complexity in the Python programming language
3. be able to informally reason about the correctness of such programs
4. understand the basics of recursion and develop simple recursive programs

## Key Topics:
These topics will be covered (as appropriate) in the Python programming language: <br><br>
a. Problem solving methodology, e.g., by refinement of specification or top-down approach. <br>
b. Data types (e.g., int, char, etc) and structures (arrays, lists). <br>
c. Expressions (assignment, arithmetic). <br>
d. Control flow: conditional statements (if/else, switch), iteration (for, do-while, while). <br>
e. Functions. <br>
f. I/O (console, files (text, binary)). <br>
g. Introduction to local and global impacts of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.
