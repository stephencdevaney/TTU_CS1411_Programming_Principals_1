20. (Chapter 2, Text book page 153)
Write a program that prompts for an integer and prints the integer, but if something other than an
integer is input, the program keeps asking for an integer. Here is a sample session:
Input an integer: abc
Error: try again. Input an integer: 4a
Error: try again. Input an integer: 2.5
Error: try again. Input an integer: 123
The integer is: 123
29. (Chapter 2, text book page 156)
Create a program that prompts for a positive number greater than 2 (check this condition), then keeps
taking the square root of this number until the square root is less than 2. Print the value each time the
square root is taken, along with the number of times the operation has been completed. For example:
Enter an integer greater than 2: 20
1: 4.472
2: 2.115
3: 1.454
Extra: Look ahead to string formatting (Section 4.4) to print the values to only 3 decimal places as
shown.
